// INSTRUCTIONS

// Write code here that with the help of jQuery adds 
// the different months and their images to the DOM,
// each inside its' own little 'box'.
// Try to use a loop for this!

// When you click on the January box the text 
// 'January is the 1:st month of the year' should show inside the Janauary box
// When you click on the February box the text
// 'February is the 2:nd month of the year' should show inside the February box etc
//
// Try to use just ONE event handler for all the boxes!

// When you click once more on a box the extra text should be hidden again!
